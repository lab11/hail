Hardware files
==============

Hail was created in [Eagle](http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) and the `hail.sch` and
`hail.brd` files are Eagle schematic and board files respectively.

`hail_bom.xlsx` is the Bill of Materials (list of parts). It is also provided
as `.txt` and `.csv` files for convenience.


Rev C changes
-------------

 * Connected ADVREFP to VDDANA.
 * Replace Lab11 logo with text. In practice, it didn't print correctly.
